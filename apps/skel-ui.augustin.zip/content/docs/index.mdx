description: Skel UI resolves the challenges of implementing skeletons by eliminating the need to create dedicated loading screens and providing an easier way to manage skeleton states using react-context.
---

import Portal from "app/Portal";
import PostCard from "content/code/components/PostCard.tsx";

## Installation

Install the package into your project via command line.

```package-install
@skel-ui/react
```

## Importing CSS

Import the CSS file into the root of your application.

```js
import "@skel-ui/react/styles.css";
```

## Start crafting UI

Now you are ready to develop your UI.

<Portal>
  <PostCard />
</Portal>

```json doc-gen:file
{
  "file": "content/code/components/PostCard.tsx",
  "codeblock": {
    "lang": "tsx"
  }
}
```

Now, not only have you designed the skeleton, but you have also done the actual UI. Additionally, the loading state for the entire UI is handled in a single place at the `<Skel.Root>` .

## Customization

Customize the default color and border-radius of skeleton using css variables.

```css title="global.css"
:root {
  --skel-ui-color: #cbd5e1;
  --skel-ui-radius: 0.5rem;
}
```

Each `Skel.Item` will have a `data-loading` attribute that is set to `"true"` when the item is in a loading state, and `"false"` otherwise. You can use this attribute in your CSS to create styles based on the loading state.

```css
/* This style will be applied during loading. */
.user-email[data-loading="true"] {
  width: 5rem;
}

/* This style will be applied after loading is complete. */
.user-email[data-loading="false"]:hover {
  background: #f97316;
}
```
